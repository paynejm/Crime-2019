The purpose of this application is to symbolize the crime rate for each state in the year of 2019 and allow the user to distinguish relationships between states. It is an interactive choropleth map with a small “guess the answer” section and a hover function allowing the user to see the crime rate and name for each individual state. A choropleth map utilizing geoJSON was used to visualize the data because it was the most convenient and was the simplest way to store and display the data. I chose [this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/13/most-dangerous-states-in-america-violent-crime-murder-rate/40968963/) to create a visual application for because it is a topic that is interesting to me and I was also intrigued to see what the final product would reveal about the information. The crime rate for each state is calculated using the number of crimes per 100,000 individuals of the population.
